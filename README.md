Description: This projects goal was to build an interactive daily schduler app. The challenge of building this app was to connect the java script to the prebuilt css and the bootstrap and jquery utilized in the app. The other challenge to this project was having to store the information entered into the app and save it to the local storage. 

Installation: To start this project I knew I needed to add more hours for the app to have a full day. I copied the divs and made a full day worth. Another function of the app was adding the current date to the app. I did this by creating a dayjs function. Then I needed to add colors for the calender depending on the time. I created a style class for past, present, and future. Finally I had to add a click function to be able to save anything you type and then add it into local storage. 

Usage: This app has a lot of real world application. It could be a great place to store and save information that helps an indivdual plan their day. It also is a greta example of bootstrap, and jquery working together to build a powerful app. 


Credits: We went through a lot of this material in class, and that helped me to be successful on this project. I also got some tutoring help as well which help me to finalize the little touches I needed help with.
